# iniad-fake-hompage
This is a project to build up a (fake) homepage of INIAD using Nodejs and express.js. The purpose is to practice Nodejs and for a teamwork at school.  
It was deployed on heroku with the URL: https://online-class.herokuapp.com/  
The user and password is `1`.

# What I used
**Techonologies**: Nodejs and express.js.  
**Database**: .json file (since I did not know how to integrate Nodejs to DB at tha time).  

# Features
It was a fake website, so it does not have real data. However, it has the note-taking part in markdown which is different from the original. Also, you can see other student's notes if they allow it.  

# Please dont
Please dont try XSS on it. It was made with no security perspective in mind.
